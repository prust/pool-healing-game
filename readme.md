# The Pool-Healing Game

This is a simple game based on John chapter 5 that I created with my 7-year-old son. It's written in Javascript / WebGL using [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and [tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/).

In the game, you are Jesus (the guy with the white clothes) and your goal is to heal the paralyzed man (the guy in the green clothes) without getting caught by the Pharisees (the guys with grey clothes).

You can move by **using the arrow keys** to turn and to walk forward and backward and you can heal the paralyzed man by pressing **the space key**. The Pharisees turn blue when they see the paralyzed man, so you have to heal him (by pressing the spacebar) when none of them are looking -- when none of them are blue. You then have to sneak away -- as Jesus did -- before any of the Pharisees notice what you've done. If they see the healed man before you get far enough away, they turn red and attack you and you lose.
